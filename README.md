# PhD Thesis: Agent-Enhanced Platform Engineering

**Candidate:** Siim Vene  
**Institution:** TalTech (Tallinn University of Technology)  
**Track:** Industry Doctorate (3-year)  
**Started:** 2026

## Thesis Statement

> Platform engineering is evolving from declarative automation to agent-augmented systems. This thesis examines how AI agents can enhance platform engineering across the full lifecycle—from infrastructure design through deployment to operations—while maintaining the trust and governance required for enterprise environments.

---

## The Opportunity

Platform engineering involves repetitive, context-heavy work where AI agents can help:

| Phase | Agent Opportunities |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Design** | Architecture review, pattern suggestion, documentation |
| **Build** | IaC generation, config review, test generation |
| **Deploy** | Deployment planning, rollout coordination, rollback |
| **Operate** | Monitoring triage, incident diagnosis, runbook execution |
| **Govern** | Compliance checking, policy enforcement, audit prep |

---

## Research Questions

1. **Where** in the platform lifecycle can agents add most value?
2. **How** do we maintain trust and governance at enterprise scale?
3. **What patterns** enable effective human-agent collaboration?
4. **What barriers** exist to adoption and how to address them?

---

## Key Contributions

1. **Lifecycle Mapping** — Where agents add value across platform engineering
2. **Integration Patterns** — Documented patterns for human-agent collaboration
3. **Trust Framework** — The Trust Equation and governance for scale
4. **Practical Guidance** — Implementation approaches from real experience
5. **Adoption Roadmap** — How organizations can get started

## Grounded in Practice

This is an **industry doctorate** drawing on:

- 15 years infrastructure/platform architecture experience
- Current: GitOps framework, K8s-as-a-service at SMIT (government)
- Building: SwarmOps multi-agent orchestration
- Teaching: Platform engineering at TalTech
- Founding: Kleidia (NIS2 compliance context)

Not theoretical — formalizing what's already being done.
